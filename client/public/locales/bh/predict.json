  "age_question": "What is your age?",
  "age_placeholder": "Enter your age here",
  "age_why": "The older you get the diabetes risk increases. Being more than 45 years of age is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. People of this age and older should take active steps to prevent the condition, including regular, light-to-moderate exercise and a controlled diet.",
  "gender_question": "What is your gender?",
  "gender_why": "While men are almost twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as women, some researches suggests that women with diabetes may be more likely to develop complications than men.",
  "polyuria_question": "Have you found yourself urinating more than usual in recent time?",
  "polyuria_why": "When you have diabetes your kidneys are forced to work overtime to filter and absorb the excess glucose. When your kidneys can't keep up, the excess glucose is excreted into your urine, dragging along fluids from your tissues, which makes you dehydrated. This will usually leave you feeling thirsty. As you drink more fluids to quench your thirst, you'll urinate even more.",
  "polydipsia_question": "Have you found yourself urinating more than usual in recent time?",
  "polydipsia_why": "When you have diabetes your kidneys are forced to work overtime to filter and absorb the excess glucose. When your kidneys can't keep up, the excess glucose is excreted into your urine, dragging along fluids from your tissues, which makes you dehydrated. This will usually leave you feeling thirsty. As you drink more fluids to quench your thirst, you'll urinate even more.",
  "sudden_weight_loss_question": "Have you been experiencing sudden weight loss in recent time?",
  "sudden_weight_loss_why": "Insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood into the body’s cells to use as energy. When this occurs, the body starts burning fat and muscle for energy, causing a reduction in overall body weight.",
  "weakness_question": " Have you been experiencing excessive tiredness or fatigue?",
  "weakness_why": "People with diabetes often feel tired due to problems with circulation. This is a common symptom of diabetes, so if you aren’t experiencing this problem, that’s good news! However, if you are exhibiting other signs of diabetes, you need to speak to your GP.",
  "polyphagia_question": "Have you been experiencing a strong sensation of hunger or desire to eat more often?",
  "polyphagia_why": "In people with diabetes, glucose can’t enter cells to be used for energy. This can be due to either low insulin levels or insulin resistance. Because your body can’t convert this glucose to energy, you’ll begin to feel very hungry.",
  "genital_thrush_question": "Have you been experiencing problems with infections, especially in genital area?",
  "genital_thrush_why": "High levels of sugar in your blood also mean high sugar levels in your sweat, saliva, and urine. That encourages yeast to grow in places like your mouth and genitals, and you can end up with thrush.",
  "visual_blurring_question": "Have you noticed any changes to your vision?",
  "visual_blurring_why": "Diabetes can cause problems with vision; however, early stage diabetic retinopathy may be asymptomatic. If you are experiencing other symptoms of diabetes, it’s important to speak to your GP.",
  "itching_question": "Have you been experiencing problems with itching?",
  "itching_why": "Localized itching is often caused by diabetes. It can be caused by a yeast infection, dry skin, or poor circulation. When poor circulation is the cause of itching, the itchiest areas may be the lower parts of the legs.",
  "irritability_question": "Have you experienced recent tingling or a pins and needles sensation in the hands or feet?",
  "irritability_why": "Diabetes can lead to tingling in the hands and feet caused by inflammation of blood vessels. However, these symptoms can take several years to start after you develop diabetes. Not having this symptom is a good sign but not conclusive on its own.",
  "delayed_healing_question": "Have you noticed that any cuts and grazes you might have seem to be taking longer to heal than usual?",
  "delayed_healing_why": "Diabetes causes levels of blood glucose to rise, which can lead to poor circulation. This means if you cut yourself, it can be harder for the blood to reach the area affected in order to repair it. However, slow wound healing can also happen as a result of ageing, or of other conditions including zinc deficiency.",
  "partial_paresis_question": "Have you been experiencing paresis on some part of you body?",
  "partial_paresis_why": "",
  "muscle_stiffness_question": "Have you been experiencing some difficulty to move more than usual?",
  "muscle_stiffness_why": "Diabetes can damage the nerves that supply the hands and feet. When the muscles of the limbs are affected, the decreased blood flow can lead to cramping and to painful walking.",
  "alopecia_question": "Have you encountered hair loss from some or all areas of the body?",
  "alopecia_why": "People with diabetes are more likely to have a condition called alopecia. With alopecia, the immune system attacks the hair follicles, leading to patches of hair loss on the head and on other parts of the body.",
  "obesity_question": "Do you have a problem with your weight?",
  "obesity_why": "Although being overweight can be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes this is not definitive symptom of the condition."
